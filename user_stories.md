## ðŸ‘¤ User Stories

1. As a **remote worker new to Warsaw**,  
   I want to see cafes where people usually work with laptops,  
   so I donâ€™t waste hours walking around unfamiliar places.

2. As a **freelancer with client calls**,  
   I want to know which cafes are quieter,  
   so I can schedule meetings without background noise.

3. As a **student on a budget**,  
   I want to find cafes where staying for a few hours is acceptable,  
   so I can study without feeling pressured to leave.

4. As a **local who already knows big chains**,  
   I want to discover smaller independent spots,  
   so I can change the scenery and support local businesses.

5. As a **tourist combining work and travel**,  
   I want quick access to a cafeâ€™s website or Google Maps,  
   so I can plan my day without juggling multiple apps.
